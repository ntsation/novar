# Changelog

## Unreleased

* **Optional table columns:** a field typed `T?` in a table's row type is a nullable Arrow column. Empty CSV
  cells, Parquet nulls and Arrow nulls from Python become `None`; `from_rows` writes `None` as null. A required
  column that finds an empty value now says to declare it `T?`.
* **Table methods:** `t.head(n)`, `t.tail(n)`, `t.sort_by("col")`, `t.sort_by_desc("col")`, `t.filter(r => ...)` and
  `a.concat(b)` return a table of the same row type. They use Arrow directly, so they work in `telvax-lite` too.
* **`telvax doc`:** writes a Markdown reference from the code: functions with their signatures, `type` fields
  and defaults, `enum` variants, `trait` and `extend` methods, and the `#` comment lines directly above each
  item. `telvax doc src/ -o REFERENCE.md`; `--public` skips names that start with `_`. It is the library
  `telvax_doc`.
* **Notebooks:** `pip install "telvax[kernel]"` adds a Jupyter kernel for Telvax (over `ipykernel`): each cell
  is Telvax, definitions and variables last from one cell to the next, the value of the last expression is
  shown (a table or a tensor as HTML), what the program prints is the cell's output, an error shows the line,
  Tab completes and Shift+Tab shows the type. `%load_ext telvax` adds `%%telvax` to a Python notebook. In Python,
  `telvax.Session` is the engine of both (`eval`, `type_of`, `complete`, `hover`, `variables`, `reset`).
  `python -m telvax.kernel install` registers the kernel when pip's data files are not used.
* **`telvax repl` completion:** Tab in the middle of a line, or on an empty line before the cursor, now completes
  at the cursor instead of four columns off.
* **HTML for tables and tensors:** `telvax_runtime::rich::html` shows a table as an HTML table (the first 50
  rows) and a tensor as a grid, for notebooks and pages.
* **A console in the playground:** under the editor, the same session as `telvax repl` runs in the browser.
  Definitions and variables last from one input to the next, a block ends with an empty line, Tab completes names,
  fields and methods, the arrow keys go through earlier lines, and `:type`, `:vars`, `:defs`, `:load`, `:reset`,
  `:clear` and `:help` are commands. **Load the program** enters the functions, types and variables of the editor.
  It has no files, environment or network, and a runaway input stops at the step limit.
* **`telvax repl`:** an interactive session. Type a definition (`fn`, `type`, `enum`, `trait`, `extend`,
  `import`), a variable (`let`, `var`), a statement or an expression and see the value. Definitions and
  variables last from one input to the next; a name can be defined again; a type error shows the line and
  leaves the session as it was. Blocks span lines and end with an empty line; Tab completes names, fields and
  methods; `:type`, `:vars`, `:defs`, `:load`, `:reset`, `:help` and `:quit`; history in `~/.telvax_history`;
  `--allow` as for `telvax run`. The session is the library `telvax_repl`, which the playground will use.
* **Debugging in VS Code:** the extension contributes a `telvax` debugger that starts `telvax dap`. F5 on a
  `.tvx` file debugs it without a `launch.json`; the commands **Telvax: Debug Current File** and **Telvax: Run
  Current File Without Debugging** are in the run menu of Telvax files; a launch configuration takes
  `program`, `function`, `args`, `stopOnEntry`, `noDebug` and `allow`. The test that runs inside a real VS
  Code now sets a breakpoint and reads the stack and variables.
* **`telvax dap`, a debug adapter:** speaks the Debug Adapter Protocol on standard input and output, so an
  editor can run a `.tvx` file in the interpreter and stop it at breakpoints (a breakpoint on a line with no
  statement moves to the next one), step over, into and out, pause, look at the calls in progress, open
  variables (lists, maps, types, variants and tuples expand), hover over a name or a field such as `p.x`, and
  see what the program prints in the debug console. The launch configuration takes `program`, `function`,
  `args`, `stopOnEntry`, `noDebug` and `allow`. The VS Code extension does not use it yet.
* **`telvax profile`:** runs a function and reports the time and calls per function (in the function
  itself and with its calls), the hits and time per statement, the time, rows and bytes of each `std`
  operation (`std.tensor.matmul`, `std.table.sql`, ...), and the memory (peak, bytes and number of
  allocations, and the bytes each function allocated). `--top N` limits the statements, `--json`,
  `--collapsed` (flame graph stacks) and `--speedscope` write files. It profiles the interpreter, not
  `telvax build` programs. In the library, `telvax_runtime::profile` and `telvax_runtime::alloc_count`.
* **Debugger hook in the interpreter:** `telvax_runtime::debug` lets a debugger be called before each
  statement, with the calls in progress, the variables of each call (name, type, value) and a way to
  look into lists, maps, types and variants. It is the base for a debug adapter; there is no `telvax debug`
  command or editor support yet. Without a debugger the cost is one flag check per statement.
* **References and rename across files:** find references and rename now follow `import` and
  `from .. import` into the other files of the project, for functions, types, enums, traits, variants,
  fields and methods. One rename edits every file that uses the name; a name imported `as` another keeps
  that alias. Files open in the editor count with their unsaved text. A rename is refused when a file
  has a syntax error, when the name belongs to a dependency, or when the project would have more errors
  after it (a collision). Go to definition on an imported type or variant opens the file that declares it.
* **Go to definition, references and rename for more than variables:** they now work on `type`s, `enum`s,
  `trait`s and aliases (in annotations, `impl`, constructions and patterns), enum variants
  (`Shape.Circle`, `case Shape.Circle(r)`), fields (`p.x`, `Point(x: 1)`, `Point(x: a)` patterns), methods
  (`p.norm()`, `Point.new()`) and top-level `let` globals. Renaming a method also renames it in the trait
  and in the types that implement it. While the file has a syntax error, definition and references keep
  working from the last good analysis, with positions moved past the edit; rename waits until the file parses.
  References no longer take the first match for the declaration, and the check that a rename does not
  collide with another name analyses the file with its imports.
* **Completion in context:** the language server now offers types after `:` and `->`, inside `List[..]`,
  `Map[..]` and `Table[..]`, after `type Id =` and for the fields of a `type` (built-in types, your
  `type`s, `enum`s, `trait`s, aliases and the type parameters in scope). After a dot it knows the methods
  of `Text`, `List`, `Map`, `Option`, `Result`, `Tensor` and `Table`, the methods of your types and the
  defaults of the traits they implement, and the methods of a trait-typed value; it follows calls in a
  chain (`s.trim().`, `xs.first().unwrap().`). `Shape.` lists the variants of an enum and `Point.` the
  functions without `self`. In a closure that is still being typed, the parameter has the type of the
  elements (`xs.map(p => p.`, `std.table.filter(t, r => r.`). Inside a string, the columns of a table are
  offered for `t["`, `t.sql("..` and `std.table.f(t, "..`; other strings and comments offer nothing.
  Items fit the type the code wants first (the parameter of the call, a `return`, the variable being
  assigned), then names in scope, then declarations, then keywords, and carry a detail and a short
  description. The method lists come from one table that the type checker also uses for its suggestions.
* **VS Code README:** the install commands pointed at `ntsation/telvax`, which does not exist; they use `telvax/telvax`.
* **VS Code snippets and a fuller README:** the extension adds snippets for `fn`, `main`, `type`, `enum`,
  `match`, `for`, `test`, `endpoint` and `trait`. Its README lists references, rename and formatting and
  explains how the release publishes to the Marketplace and Open VSX.
* **The documentation is tested:** every ```` ```telvax ```` block in the README, the tour and the use cases is
  checked, checked for formatting and, when it has `fn main`, run; every file under `examples/` is checked
  and checked for formatting. A block that is only a piece of a program is marked ```` ```telvax ignore ````.
  The tour and the use cases now format cleanly and read `examples/dataframe/sales.csv` from the repository root.
* **Lint rules you can configure:** the checks of `telvax lint` now have names (`unused-variable`,
  `unused-function`, `unreachable-case`) and a level, `allow`, `warn` (the default) or `deny`. Set them in
  a `[lint]` table in `telvax.toml` or with `--allow`, `--warn` and `--deny <rule>`; the flags win.
  `telvax lint --list-rules` lists them. A `deny`ed rule is an error and makes the command fail.
* **`telvax fmt` takes directories and shows a diff:** a directory means every `.tvx` file under it (hidden
  folders, `target`, `node_modules` and `.tvpm` are skipped), and no path means this directory.
  `--diff` prints the lines that would change as `@@ line N @@` blocks and writes nothing; like `--check`,
  it exits 1 when something would change. An unknown option is an error.
* **Coverage in `telvax test`:** `--coverage` prints, for each file of the project, the lines with code that
  the tests ran and the ones they did not; `--fail-under N` fails the run when fewer than N% ran. It
  counts lines, not branches, and leaves out the `test_`, `fixture_`, `teardown_` and `cases_` functions.
* **Mocks in `telvax test`:** `std.test.mock(price, fake_price)` or `std.test.mock("std.fs.read", fake_read)`
  replaces a function until the test ends; `std.test.calls(target)` counts the calls. A replacement for
  one of your functions must have its type.
* **Cases in `telvax test`:** `fn cases_double() -> List[(Int, Int)]` runs `test_double(x, want)` once for
  each item and lists each run as `test_double[(2, 4)]`. A tuple fills the first parameters; the rest are
  fixtures. An empty list or items of the wrong type fail the test with a message.
* **Fixtures in `telvax test`:** a test can take parameters; `fn test_x(db: Db)` gets `fixture_db()`, made
  again for each test, and `teardown_db(db)` runs after it even when the test fails. Fixtures can take
  other fixtures. `telvax lint` no longer calls `test_`, `fixture_` and `teardown_` functions unused.
* **`telvax test` takes a directory:** it runs every `test_*.tvx` and `*_test.tvx` file under it (no
  path means this directory), prints each file, and ends with one total. Files with no tests are skipped.
* **`tvpm new` writes valid Telvax, and `tvpm publish` checks first:** the files `new` and `init` create
  used `def` and `str` and failed `telvax check`; they now use `fn` and `Text`. `publish` type-checks the
  package (with its dependencies) and refuses to publish one that has errors, showing them. `tvpm check`,
  `run`, `serve` and `build` in a package with no dependencies no longer ask for `tvpm lock`.
* **`tvpm update [name...]`:** moves the locked versions to the newest that the requirements allow and
  says what changed (`updated mathx 1.0.0 -> 1.2.0`, `added`, `removed`, or `everything is up to date`),
  then downloads what is missing. With names, only those packages move and the others stay at their
  locked version unless a requirement forces them. Before, the only way to pick up a new version was to
  delete `telvax.lock`.
* **`telvax run` reads its arguments by type:** the words after the function are read as the types it
  declares, so `Text` keeps `123` as text and a `List[Int]` takes `[1,2,3]`. A wrong word says which
  argument and which type (`argument `b` of `add` is Int, and `x` is not a value of that type`), a
  wrong count lists the parameters, and an unknown function lists the ones the file has. The function
  name is optional: `telvax run app.tvx` runs `main`. Only `telvax check` prints "ok" now; `run`,
  `test` and `serve` no longer do.
* **`telvax check` takes many files, a package and `--json`:** `telvax check a.tvx b.tvx` checks each
  and says how many failed; `telvax check` with no file checks the entry of the package around the
  current directory (`telvax.toml`); `telvax check --json` prints one JSON array on stdout with, for
  each diagnostic, `file`, `line`, `column`, `end_line`, `end_column` (1-based), `severity`, `message`
  and `notes`. The exit code is 1 when any file has an error, in both modes.
* **`telvax doctor`:** prints the version, the syntax editions it reads, which features this binary was
  built with (tables, live services, GPU, native backend) and the environment variables that change
  its behavior; keys are shown as set or not set, never their value. An unknown command now says
  `unknown command `chek`; did you mean `check`?` instead of printing the whole usage.
* **The syntax is stable from here on:** programs in `tests/editions/2026/` are frozen and must keep
  passing `check`, `fmt --check` and their tests; a test fails if one is edited. `telvax.toml` takes
  `edition = "2026"` (`tvpm new` writes it; an unknown edition is an error). A change that would break
  an old program becomes a new edition. The rules are in `docs/guide/stability.md`.
* **`--allow` limits what a program may do:** `telvax run`, `test` and `serve` take
  `--allow fs.read,fs.write,fs,env,net,all,none`. A call that needs a capability that was not listed
  stops with a message that names the word to add. Without the flag everything is allowed, as before.
  The check happens when the program runs; it is not part of the types.
* **Built-in macros:** `assert!(cond)` quotes the condition when it fails, `assert!(cond, "message")`,
  `dbg!(value)` prints `value = result` to stderr and gives the value back, and `todo!()`,
  `unreachable!()` and `panic!("message")` stop the program (and fit any type). An unknown `name!(...)`
  names the macros that exist. Users cannot define macros. The formatter and the VS Code grammar know
  the `name!(` form.
* **The `|>` operator follows one rule:** `x |> stage` is the call `stage` with `x` as its first argument.
  Names and defaults now count that argument (`1 |> scale(k: 3)` and `1 |> scale` used to fail with
  "missing the argument" and "expected 2 argument(s)"), and a suffix after the stage applies to the
  result of the call (`s |> parse()?`, `n |> make().field`, `n |> items()[0]`; the first two were errors).
  `|>` binds looser than every operator, and the error for `x |> f == 1` says to write `(x |> f()) == 1`.
* **Inferred return type, more places:** a method without `->` (in a `type`, an `extend`, or an
  associated function) returns the type of its last expression; a method that implements a trait returns
  what the trait declares for it; and a global can call a function that has no `->`. `main`, tests,
  endpoints and generic functions still need it.
* **A generic that grows forever is an error:** `fn f[T](x: T): f([x])` is instantiated for `T`, then
  `List[T]`, then `List[List[T]]`, and so on; the checker never finished and used all the memory. A type
  of more than 200 parts in an instance is now an error that says the types keep growing.
* **Deeply nested code no longer hangs or crashes the compiler:** parentheses inside parentheses were
  read twice per level, so twenty levels took seconds and forty never finished; they now take linear
  time. Blocks nested past 64 levels and brackets past 200 are an error that says so, and the parser and
  the checker run on a stack of their own, so a long sum or calls inside calls are checked instead of
  overflowing the stack and ending the process.
* **Methods with type parameters of their own:** `fn map[U](self, f: (T) -> U) -> Stack[U]` in a generic
  or a plain `type`, or in an `extend`. The parameters are inferred from the call and may have limits
  (`[N: Num]`). Before, they were an error ("not supported yet").
* **Type arguments in a call:** `empty[Text]()`, `pair[Int, Text](1, "a")`. It makes a generic function
  that cannot infer its types from the arguments usable, and the "cannot infer" error now says so.
* **Built-in limits for type parameters:** `T: Num`, `T: Ord` and `T: Eq` (and `T: (Num, Ord)`) without
  declaring a trait. A call with a type that does not meet a limit is reported once, at the call, instead
  of again inside the generic function's body.
* **Function types:** `(Int, Int) -> Int` is a type, so a function can be a parameter, a field, a list
  element or a return value (`fn adder(n: Int) -> (Int) -> Int: x => x + n`). `() -> ()` stands for no
  value. A field that holds a function can be called (`handler.run(5)`), and a closure parameter can
  carry its type: `(x: Int) => x + 1`.
* **Imports can be renamed:** `from util import clamp as limit`, `import util.clamp as limit`. Importing
  a module as a whole (`import util`) is an error that says to write `from util import name`, and the
  messages for the modules of your own project no longer say `crate`.
* **Syntax errors say what to write:** a `{ }` body, a parameter without a type, `: Type` for a return
  type, and `use`, `const` and `function` now get the same hint as `def` and `pub`. The extra
  "unexpected `def`" that came before the hint is gone.
* **Methods on `Result` and `Option`:** `Result` has `is_ok`, `is_err`, `unwrap`, `expect`,
  `unwrap_or`, `unwrap_or_else`, `map`, `map_err`, `and_then`, `ok` and `err`; `Option` gains `map`,
  `and_then`, `filter`, `ok_or`, `unwrap_or_else` and `expect`. They are checked: a method that does not
  exist on a `Result` is an error (it used to pass without a type).
* **Inferred return type:** a top-level function without `->` returns the type of its last expression
  (`fn double(x: Int): x * 2` returns an `Int`). `main`, tests, endpoints, generic functions and
  methods still need the `->`.
* **Generic calls and literals:** `let a = id(3)` no longer fixes `a` to `i32` at the call; a later use
  such as `let n: Int = a` decides the type, and the default applies only if nothing does.

## 0.1.0

**Breaking: a new syntax.** Telvax is now easy to read for anyone who knows Python (blocks by
indentation, no braces or semicolons) and keeps its own words and ideas. The Rust-style syntax is gone.
The design is in `docs/design/sintaxe-pythonica.md`; the checker, the interpreter and the native
backend are unchanged except where noted.

```telvax
type Query:
    text: Text
    top_k: Int = 5

fn embed(text: Text) -> Tensor[f32, 768]:
    text
        |> std.text.clean_whitespace()
        |> std.text.truncate(512)
        |> embedder.embed()

@endpoint(POST, "/v1/rag/query")
fn handle(q: Query) -> Result[Reply, Status]:
    let docs = search(embed(q.text), limit: q.top_k)
    ...
```

### Language
* **Blocks:** a line that ends with `:` opens an indented block; `#` starts a comment.
* **Functions and variables:** `fn name(a: Int) -> Int:`; the last expression is the value, `return`
  leaves early. `let x = 1` cannot change, `var x = 1` can; a plain `x = 2` never declares.
* **Types:** `Int`, `Float`, `Text`, `Bool`, `List[T]`, `Map[K, V]`, `T?` for a value that may be `None`,
  `Result[T, E]`, `Tensor[f32, 2, 3]` (the dimensions follow the element type) and `Table[Row]`; sized
  numbers keep `i8`..`i64`, `u8`..`u64`, `f32`, `f64`. Error messages use the same names.
* **Your own types:** `type Point:` with fields and methods in one block, `type Circle(Shape)` to implement
  a trait, `extend Point:`, `enum Shape:` with one variant per line, `trait Shape:` and `type Stack[T]:`.
* **Named arguments and defaults:** `Query(text: "x")`, `search(q, limit: 3)`; a field or a parameter can
  have a default (`top_k: Int = 5`). Names are checked against the function.
* **Functions as values:** `x => x + 1`, `(a, b) => a + b`; an `fn` inside a function is a closure with
  several statements.
* **Words and operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`, `in`, `elif`, `True` / `False` / `None`, `a if c else b`,
  `for i in range(n)`, `for i, x in items`, `pass`. `x is Some(v)` replaces `if let` and `while let`.
* **Modules:** `.` replaces `::`; `from util import clamp`, `import util.clamp`. A name that starts with `_`
  is private; there is no `pub`.
* `@endpoint(POST, "/path")`; `print` ends the line (`std.io.print` does not); values print as
  `True`, `None`, `Point(x=1, y=2)`.
* Kept: `|>` (a line may start with it), `?`, `Some`, `Ok`, `Err`.

### Tools
* `telvax fmt` is rebuilt for indentation and checks that the tokens are unchanged.
* `telvax lint` no longer reports "needless `mut`"; an unused private function is one whose name starts
  with `_`.
* The language server, the VS Code grammar and the playground follow the new syntax.
* Syntax errors say what to write: `def` -> `fn`, a missing `:`, `;`, `..`, `x = 1` without `let`.
* `telvax-migrate` (`tools/migrate`) converts files written in the old Rust-style syntax and keeps their
  comments: `cargo run -p telvax_migrate -- file.tvx`. It will be removed in a later release.

### Moving a program
Run `telvax-migrate` on each file. What it cannot carry over: an `if` or `match` used as a value (write a
conditional expression, or assign inside the branches), blocks used as expressions, closed ranges
(`0..=n` is `range(0, n + 1)`), and typed closure parameters.

## 0.0.5

The project is now called **Telvax** (it was Novar). Everything was renamed: the binaries are `telvax`
and `tvpm`, source files end in `.tvx`, environment variables start with `TELVAX_`, the manifest is
`telvax.toml`, and the repository is `telvax/telvax`. Releases before this one keep the old names.

### Language
* **Errors and control flow:** `expr?` passes the error of a `Result` (or the `None` of an `Option`) up
  to the caller, and `if let` / `while let` match a single pattern.
* **Tuples:** the type `(A, B)`, values, `.0` / `.1`, patterns, and destructuring in `let`, `for` and
  closure parameters.
* **Iterator methods on `Vec`:** `map`, `filter`, `any`, `all`, `find`, `enumerate`, `zip`, `sum`, `min`,
  `max`, `fold`, `for_each`, `skip`, `join`; `Map::entries`.
* **`impl` blocks, traits and generics:** methods on structs and enums, `trait` with
  `impl Trait for Type`, trait-typed values dispatched at run time, and generic functions, structs,
  enums and impls with trait bounds.
* The new syntax runs in the interpreter; the native backend does not compile it yet.

### Docs and examples
* A use-cases guide (`docs/guide/use-cases.md`) and four new runnable examples: word count, a
  shape-checked network, an HTTP service that needs no model, and error handling with `?`.

### Fixes and security
* `rustls` 0.23.46 (RUSTSEC-2026-0349).
* The table tests no longer share a scratch file, and the bundle test waits for the server to answer.

### Releases
* Every pull request merged into `main` is now released automatically with the next patch version,
  so no file needs editing. The VS Code extension is packaged and attached to each release, and
  published to the Marketplace and Open VSX when their tokens are configured.

## 0.0.4

### Language
* **Friendlier syntax** (all additive): `println`, `print`, `read_csv` and `read_parquet` work
  without `std::`; tensors have methods (`x.matmul(w).relu().softmax()`, `sales.price.mean()`) and
  operators (`a + b`, `a * 2.0`); tables have `.sql(...)`; a row type can be written in place
  (`Table<{ region: String, revenue: f64 }>`); `fn main()` may return nothing.
* `Option<T>` (`Some`, `None`, `match`, `unwrap`, `unwrap_or`, ...) and `Map<K, V>` (`std::map::new()`,
  `insert`, `get`, `remove`, `contains_key`, `keys`, `values`, ...), also across the Python and JSON
  boundaries. `Vec` gains `first`, `last`, `pop`, `get`, `sort`, `reverse`; `String` gains `find`,
  `to_int`, `to_float`, `chars`, `lines`.
* Closure parameters can be annotated (`|x: i64| x + 1`), and assigning to a captured variable is a
  compile error (closures capture by value).

### Tools
* The language server finds references and renames variables and functions (a rename that would
  collide with another name is refused). `telvax fmt` indents the line after a trailing `=`.
* Quantization: `--quantize int8-channel` and `--quantize int4-channel` (interpreter only).

### GPU
* Nested tensor operations (`softmax(matmul(relu(matmul(x, w1)), w2))`) keep their intermediate
  results on the GPU. On the M4 a 3-layer network takes 44 ms against 9.0 s in the CPU interpreter;
  the chaining itself saves little there because memory is shared.

### Verification
* The playground page is tested in a real Chromium (Playwright), the extension inside a real VS
  Code, and every published release is installed and run on Linux, macOS and Windows by the release
  workflow. The LLVM job is blocking.
* CI also runs a build of the ~10 MB `lite` binary.


## 0.0.3

### Size
* Two builds per system: the full `telvax` (about 51 MB, down from 58 with full LTO) and a new
  `telvax-lite` (about 10 MB) without SQL and Parquet (tables in memory and CSV still work). `TELVAX_LITE=1` makes the install scripts
  pick it. Build it yourself with `--no-default-features --features live`.

### Language and errors
* `String`: `contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `replace`, `split`. `Vec`: `push`, `contains`.
* A method that does not exist on a built-in type is a compile error (it used to fail only when
  run), and misspelled names, types, fields and methods get a "did you mean ...?" note.
* A missing `;` is reported right after the previous token instead of listing every token that
  could follow.

### Dependencies
* `wgpu` 30 (tested on a real GPU), `lsp-server` 0.10, `vscode-languageclient` 10 and TypeScript 7
  (the extension now needs VS Code 1.91), newer GitHub Actions and maturin.

### Fixes
* The Dockerfile written by `build --serve` did not create `/out`; it builds now (CI builds it).


## 0.0.2

### Language
* `break` and `continue` in `while` and `for` loops (interpreter and native backend).
* Enums with tuple and unit variants, and `match` over enums, `Result`, integers, strings and
  booleans, with exhaustiveness checking. Enums cross module boundaries and travel as JSON.
  They run in the interpreter; the native backend reports them as unsupported.

### Tools
* `telvax fmt [--check]`: a token-based formatter that keeps comments and your line breaks. The
  language server formats documents too.
* `telvax lint [--deny-warnings]`: unused variables, needless `mut`, unused private functions.
* `telvax --version` and `--help`.

### Platforms and releases
* Windows: CI builds and tests it, releases include a `.zip`, and `scripts/install.ps1` installs
  it. Windows builds have not been run on a real machine by the author.
* Release binaries for Linux arm64 and macOS Intel; pushing a higher `version` to `main` tags and
  publishes a release automatically.
* Dependabot covers Cargo, pip, npm and GitHub Actions; the `time` advisories are fixed (Rust
  1.88 or newer is required).

### Measurements and docs
* The RAG endpoint was measured against a real Ollama and PostgreSQL+pgvector: about 1.9 ms mean
  overhead (`benchmarks/README.md`).
* `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates, a CI job that builds the generated Dockerfile (not run yet).

## 0.0.1 - first public alpha

A first version for trying the language out. Expect rough edges and breaking changes.

### Works
* Front end: lexer, parser with error recovery, typed HIR, literal type inference, tensor shapes
  checked at compile time, `Table<Row>`, loops, `let mut`, arrays, f-strings, modules and `import`.
* `telvax check | run | serve | jit | build | lsp | worker`.
* Interpreter on Arrow: tensors, tables, SQL (DataFusion), CSV and Parquet.
* `@endpoint` functions served over HTTP, with JSON validation; `build --serve` bundles the
  service into one executable and can write a Dockerfile.
* `--live` talks to real Ollama, OpenAI-compatible APIs and PostgreSQL + pgvector.
* Native backend (`--features llvm`, LLVM 22): ints, floats, strings, structs, static-shape `f32`
  tensors, int8 quantized `matmul`.
* `--device gpu` (`--features gpu`): `f32` tensor operations on the GPU through wgpu.
* `--emit ptx` and `--emit stablehlo` for NVIDIA and TPU toolchains (generated, **not executed on
  that hardware**).
* `tvpm` package manager, language server, VS Code extension, Wasm playground, Python bindings
  (zero-copy NumPy, Arrow, Polars, PyTorch), Ray executor, cluster workers.

### Known limits
See [`docs/design/status.md`](docs/design/status.md). Notably: native executables do not serve HTTP
yet, PTX / StableHLO / CUDA-array interchange have not run on real NVIDIA or TPU hardware, the
Dockerfile was never built, and there are no enums, `break` or `continue`.
