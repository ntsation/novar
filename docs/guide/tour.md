# A tour of Telvax

Telvax is easy to read for anyone who knows Python: blocks are made by indentation, a block opens
with `:`, and there are no braces or semicolons. It keeps its own words (`fn`, `let` / `var`,
`type`, `x => x + 1`, `Int?`) and it checks before the program runs what Python finds out
halfway through: every name has a type, written or inferred.

The code in this guide is tested: each block that is not marked `ignore` is checked, formatted and,
when it has `fn main`, run. Run them from the root of the repository.

## Functions, types and inference

```telvax
type Point:
    x: Float
    y: Float

fn norm(p: Point) -> Float:
    p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y

fn main() -> i32:
    let p = Point(x: 3.0, y: 4.0)
    var total = 0  # an untyped literal: its type comes from the uses
    for i in range(10):
        total += i
    print(f"norm = {norm(p)}, total = {total}")
    total
```

* `let x = 1` makes a name that cannot change; `var x = 1` makes one that can (`x += 1`).
  `let x: Int = 1` writes the type down. The last expression of a function is its value, so
  `return` is only needed to leave early.
* Types start with a capital, like the types you write yourself: `Int` (64 bits), `Float`
  (64 bits), `Bool`, `Text`, `List[T]`, `Map[K, V]`, `T?` (a value or `None`), `Result[T, E]`,
  `Tensor[T, dims]` and `Table[Row]` (a table's columns may also be `Date` and `Timestamp`). When the size matters: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `u8` to `u64`,
  `f32`, `f64`.
* A function without `->` returns the type of its last expression: `fn double(x: Int): x * 2` returns
  an `Int`. It works for methods too (`fn area(self): self.r * self.r`), and a method that implements a
  trait returns what the trait declares for it. Write the `->` for `main`, tests, endpoints and generic
  functions, and when the function has an error.
* A name that starts with `_` is private to its file; everything else can be imported.
* Control flow: `if` / `elif` / `else`, `while`, `for x in items`, `for i in range(n)`,
  `for i in range(a, b)`, `break`, `continue`, `pass` and `return`. `a if cond else b` is an
  expression. `and`, `or`, `not`, `in` and `not in` are the operators.
* Comments start with `#`. Strings use `"` or `'`, and `f"..."` interpolates `{expr}`.

## Named arguments and defaults

A call can name its arguments, and a parameter or a field can have a default, so a configuration
reads like a sentence and the call that needs only the common case stays short:

```telvax
type Query:
    text: Text
    top_k: Int = 5

fn search(q: Query, limit: Int = 10, rerank: Bool = False) -> List[Text]:
    []

let q = Query(text: "tensor shapes")  # top_k is 5
let hits = search(q, rerank: True)  # limit is 10
```

Names are checked against the function: a misspelled or repeated name is a compile error.

## Pipelines

`x |> f(a)` means `f(x, a)`, so stages read left to right. A line that starts with `|>` continues
the line before it:

```telvax ignore
let answer = prompt |> llm.complete() |> std.text.trim()

let docs = query
    |> embed()
    |> store.search(3)
```

The rule is one: `x |> stage` is the call `stage` with `x` as its first argument, and then it is a call
like any other.

* The stage is a function (`x |> f`, `x |> std.text.trim`), a call (`x |> f(a)`) or a closure
  (`x |> (n => n + 1)`).
* Names and defaults count the value the pipe provides: with `fn scale(x: Int, k: Int = 2)`, both
  `1 |> scale` and `1 |> scale(k: 3)` work.
* A suffix after the stage applies to the result of the call: `s |> parse()?` is `parse(s)?`,
  `n |> make().field` is `make(n).field`, and `n |> items()[0]` is `items(n)[0]`.
* `|>` binds looser than every operator: `a + b |> f` pipes the sum, and `x |> f == 1` pipes into
  `f == 1`, which is an error. Write `(x |> f()) == 1`.

## Tensors and tables

```telvax
fn forward(x: Tensor[f32, 2, 3], w: Tensor[f32, 3, 2]) -> Tensor[f32, 2, 2]:
    x |> std.tensor.matmul(w) |> std.tensor.relu()  # [2,3] x [3,2] -> [2,2], checked

type Row:
    id: Int
    score: f32

fn best(t: Table[Row]) -> Table[Row]:
    t |> std.table.sql("SELECT * FROM t WHERE score > 0.5 ORDER BY score DESC")

fn mean_score(t: Table[Row]) -> f32:
    std.tensor.mean(t.score)  # a zero-copy column
```

`std.table.read_csv(path)`, `read_parquet` and `read_ipc` need the result type to be written down
(`let t: Table[Row] = ...`), as do `std.tensor.zeros()`, `from_vec` and `reshape`.

A table has methods that keep its rows' type. They do not need SQL, so they also work in `telvax-lite`:

```telvax
type Row:
    id: Int
    score: f32

fn top_two(t: Table[Row]) -> Table[Row]:
    t.sort_by_desc("score").head(2)

fn passed(t: Table[Row]) -> Table[Row]:
    t.filter(r => r.score > 0.5)
```

`head(n)` and `tail(n)` take the first or last `n` rows, `sort_by(column)` and `sort_by_desc(column)` order by one
column, `filter(keep)` keeps the rows for which `keep` is true, and `a.concat(b)` appends the rows of `b`
(both tables need the same row type). A column name that does not exist is a runtime error that lists the columns.

A column typed `T?` may hold empty values: `temp: f64?` reads CSV cells that are empty, Parquet nulls and
`None` from `from_rows` as `None`, and `t.temp` is then a `List[f64?]` (not a tensor). A column without `?`
that finds an empty value is an error that names the column and says to write `?`.

```telvax
type Reading:
    id: Int
    temp: f64?

fn warm(t: Table[Reading]) -> Table[Reading]:
    t.filter(r => r.temp.unwrap_or(0.0) > 20.0)
```

`Date` and `Timestamp` are column types for dates and times. In the table they are Arrow `Date32` and
`Timestamp(µs, UTC)`, so Parquet, SQL and PyArrow see real dates. In the program a value is a `Text` in ISO-8601:
`"2026-10-17"` and `"2026-10-17T16:53:03Z"`. `from_rows` and CSV accept any offset (`+02:00`) and store UTC; a
text that is not a date is an error that says to write `YYYY-MM-DD`. There is no date arithmetic yet: compare
the text, sort the table, or use SQL.

```telvax
type Event:
    id: Int
    day: Date
    at: Timestamp?

fn latest(t: Table[Event]) -> Table[Event]:
    t.sort_by_desc("day").head(1)
```

`std.table.read_ipc(path)` and `write_ipc(table, path)` read and write an Arrow IPC file (Feather v2), which PyArrow,
Polars and pandas also read and write. `read_ipc` maps the file into memory and the columns point into it, so a
file with one batch is not copied. Do not rewrite or truncate a file while a table read from it is in use. Files
compressed with LZ4 or Zstd are decoded (copying) in the full `telvax`; `telvax-lite` reads uncompressed files.

A table can be cut into chunks. `t.split(n)` gives a `List[Table[Row]]` of tables with at most `n` rows each;
they share the buffers of `t`, so nothing is copied. `std.table.read_csv_batches(path, n)`,
`read_parquet_batches` and `read_ipc_batches` read a file straight into such chunks (no joined copy of the whole
file is built), and need the result type written down: `let parts: List[Table[Row]] = ...`. Chunks are all in
memory at once; a reader that hands them out one at a time does not exist yet.

```telvax
type Row:
    id: Int
    score: f32

fn total_score(path: Text) -> f32:
    let parts: List[Table[Row]] = std.table.read_parquet_batches(path, 100000)
    var sum = 0.0
    for part in parts:
        sum += part.score.sum()
    sum
```

`std.table.read_flight(url, ticket)` fetches a table from an Arrow Flight server (`DoGet`), and
`std.table.write_flight(table, url, path)` sends one (`DoPut`). The address is `grpc://host:port`, or
`grpc+tls://host:port` for TLS. Both need the `net` permission and a build with the `flight` feature
(`cargo install telvax --features flight`); the released binaries do not include it, and without it they report
that. There is a client only, no Flight server.

## HTTP endpoints

```telvax ignore
@endpoint(POST, "/v1/score")
fn score(input: In) -> Result[Out, Status]:
    ...
```

The parameter type becomes the validated JSON body (GET/DELETE read it from the query string).
Returning `Err(Status.BadRequest("..."))` becomes an HTTP 400.

## Modules and packages

```telvax ignore
from util import clamp  # ./util.tvx
from mathx.vec import dot  # dependency `mathx`, file vec.tvx
```

`import util.clamp` brings in the same name. A name can be renamed with `as`:
`from util import clamp as limit`, `import util.clamp as limit`, `from std.text import trim as strip`.
Names from `std` need no import: `std.text.trim(s)`. A module is not a name: `import util` is an error
that says to write `from util import name`.

```sh
tvpm new app && cd app
tvpm add mathx --registry ~/registry     # or --path ../mathx
tvpm install --registry ~/registry       # resolves, writes telvax.lock, downloads
tvpm run                                  # runs src/main.tvx with the dependencies
tvpm update                               # newest versions that fit; `tvpm update mathx` moves only mathx
```

## Distribution

```telvax ignore
fn work(item: Job) -> Done:
    ...

fn run_all(jobs: List[Job]) -> List[Done]:
    std.dist.map(jobs, work)
```

`std.dist.map` takes the *name* of a top-level function. It runs on local threads by default;
`telvax run app.tvx run_all --workers host1:7077,host2:7077` sends the calls to machines running
`telvax worker`, and `telvax.ray.RayExecutor` (Python) sends them to Ray.

## Quantization

`--quantize int8` (on `run`, `serve`, `jit`, `build`) makes `f32` matrix products use symmetric
per-tensor int8 arithmetic with `i32` accumulation. The interpreter and the native backend give
identical results.

`--quantize int8-channel` and `--quantize int4-channel` (`run` and `serve`; the native backend
refuses them) give every row of the activations and every column of the weights its own scale, so
a column that is much larger or smaller than the rest no longer loses its precision. The int4 mode
stores the weights in 4 bits. Scales are computed on each call; there is no calibration step.

## Accelerators

* `--device gpu` (on `run` and `serve`, needs `cargo build --features gpu`) runs `f32` tensor operations on the GPU through `wgpu`: Metal on macOS, Vulkan on Linux, DX12 on Windows.
* `telvax build file.tvx --emit stablehlo` prints StableHLO for the tensor functions in the file, for XLA / PJRT.
* `telvax build file.tvx --emit ptx [--sm sm_80]` prints PTX kernels for the tensor operations the file uses (needs `--features llvm`).

PTX and StableHLO are generated and checked, not executed: see `docs/design/status.md`.

## Enums, `match`, `break` and `continue`

```telvax
enum Shape:
    Circle(Float)
    Rect(Float, Float)
    Empty

fn area(s: Shape) -> Float:
    match s:
        case Shape.Circle(r):
            r * r * 3.14159
        case Shape.Rect(w, h):
            w * h
        case Shape.Empty:
            0.0

fn first_over(limit: i32) -> i32:
    var found = -1
    for i in range(1, 1000):
        if i * i > limit:
            found = i
            break
    found
```

`match` must cover every case (the compiler names the missing variants) and also works on
`Result` (`Ok(v)` / `Err(e)`), integers, strings, booleans and `_`. Enums travel as JSON: a unit
variant is its name (`"Empty"`), one with values is `{"Circle": 2.0}` or `{"Rect": [2.0, 3.0]}`.
Enums run in the interpreter; the native backend does not compile them yet.

## Limiting what a program may do

A program can read and write files, read environment variables and reach the network. `--allow`
on `run`, `test` and `serve` lists what it may do; without the flag everything is allowed.

```sh
telvax run job.tvx main --allow fs.read          # may read files, nothing else
telvax test app.tvx --allow none                 # may touch nothing outside itself
telvax serve app.tvx --live --allow net,env
```

| Word | Allows |
|---|---|
| `fs.read` | `std.fs.read`, `std.fs.exists`, `read_csv`, `read_parquet`, `read_ipc` and their `_batches` forms |
| `fs.write` | `std.fs.write`, `write_csv`, `write_parquet`, `write_ipc` |
| `fs` | `fs.read` and `fs.write` |
| `env` | `std.env.get` |
| `net` | the Ollama, OpenAI and PostgreSQL clients, when `--live`, and `read_flight` / `write_flight` |
| `all`, `none` | everything, nothing |

A call that is not allowed stops the program and says which word to add:
`` `std.fs.read` needs the `fs.read` capability; run with `--allow fs.read` ``. The limit is checked when
the program runs, not when it is compiled, and `std.io.print` and `std.time` are always allowed.

## Tests

A function called `test_...` is a test. `assert(cond)` and `assert_eq(a, b)` stop
it with a message when they fail:

```telvax
fn double(x: Int) -> Int:
    x * 2

fn test_double():
    assert_eq(double(2), 4)
```

```sh
telvax test file.tvx           # run them all, exit 1 if one fails
telvax test file.tvx double    # only the tests whose name contains `double`
telvax test tests/             # every `test_*.tvx` and `*_test.tvx` file under a directory
telvax test                    # the same, in this directory
```

### Fixtures

A test that takes parameters gets them from fixtures. `fn test_total(order: Order)` calls
`fixture_order()` and passes the result; a fixture can take other fixtures the same way. Each test
gets new values. A `teardown_order(order: Order)` function, if there is one, runs after the test,
whether it passed or not.

```telvax
fn fixture_base() -> Int:
    10

fn fixture_total(base: Int) -> Int:
    base * 2

fn teardown_total(total: Int):
    print(f"done with {total}")

fn test_total(base: Int, total: Int):
    assert_eq(total, base * 2)
```

A parameter with no `fixture_...` function, or a fixture that returns another type, fails the test
and says what to write.

### Cases

To run one test on several values, write a `cases_...` function with the name of the test without
`test_`. It returns a list; the test runs once for each item. A tuple gives the first parameters of
the test, and the parameters left over are still fixtures.

```telvax ignore
fn cases_double() -> List[(Int, Int)]:
    [(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6)]

fn test_double(x: Int, want: Int):
    assert_eq(double(x), want)
```

Each run is listed as `test_double[(2, 4)]`. A `cases_...` function that is empty, or whose items do
not fit the parameters, fails the test and says why.

### Mocks

`std.test.mock(target, replacement)` makes a test call another function in place of one. The target is
one of your functions, written without quotes, or a std function by its path in text. A function
target must have the same type as its replacement; a std target is checked when the test runs.
`std.test.calls(target)` says how many times the replacement was called. Every mock is removed when
the test ends.

```telvax
fn price(item: Text) -> Int:
    100

fn total(item: Text) -> Int:
    price(item) * 2

fn fake_read(path: Text) -> Result[Text, Text]:
    Ok("from the test")

fn test_total():
    std.test.mock(price, item => 7)
    assert_eq(total("a"), 14)
    assert_eq(std.test.calls(price), 1)

fn test_read():
    std.test.mock("std.fs.read", fake_read)
    assert_eq(std.fs.read("any.txt"), Ok("from the test"))
```

A replacement cannot call the function it replaces. Calls through methods (`x.len()`) cannot be
mocked, and `std.test.*` itself cannot.

### Coverage

`--coverage` lists, for each file of the project, the lines with code and how many of them the tests
ran, and the numbers of the lines that did not run. `--fail-under 90` also fails the run, with exit
code 1, when fewer than 90% of the lines ran, so a pipeline can hold the line.

```sh
telvax test tests/ --coverage
telvax test tests/ --fail-under 90
```

```text
coverage (lines that ran / lines with code):
  src/price.tvx  18/20  90.0%   missing 14-15
  total  18/20  90.0%
```

A line counts when it has a statement, the last expression of a block or the body of a `case`. The
`test_`, `fixture_`, `teardown_` and `cases_` functions are not counted, nor are files outside the
project (the directory with `telvax.toml`, or the one you test). The count is of lines, not of
branches: a line with an `if` and its two results written on it counts once.

## Macros

A macro is written `name!(...)`. The compiler has five and you cannot define more. Each one is
rewritten into a call of a `std` function before the program is checked.

| Macro | What it does |
|---|---|
| `assert!(cond)` | like `assert`, and the message quotes the condition: `assertion failed: x > 3` |
| `assert!(cond, "message")` | stops with your message when `cond` is false |
| `dbg!(value)` | prints `value_as_written = result` to stderr and gives `value` back |
| `todo!()` | stops with `not yet implemented`; it can stand where any type is expected |
| `unreachable!()` | stops with `unreachable code was reached` |
| `panic!("message")` | stops with the message |

```telvax
fn pick(n: Int) -> Int:
    if n > 0:
        n
    else:
        todo!()

fn test_pick():
    let x = dbg!(pick(4))  # stderr: pick(4) = 4
    assert!(x == 4)
```

Macros run in the interpreter, as `assert` does; the native backend does not compile them.

## The REPL

```sh
telvax repl                    # an interactive session
telvax repl app.tvx            # start with the definitions and variables of a file
```

```text
>>> let xs = [3, 1, 2]
>>> xs.len()
3
>>> fn total(v: List[Int]) -> Int:
...     v.sum()
...
>>> total(xs)
6
>>> var n = 0
>>> for x in xs:
...     n = n + x
...
>>> n
6
>>> :type xs
List[Int]
```

You can type a definition (`fn`, `type`, `enum`, `trait`, `extend`, `import`), a variable (`let`, `var`), a
statement or an expression; the value of an expression is shown. A block ends with an empty line. Names last
until `:reset`: a name can be defined again (`let x = x + 1`, or a new `fn` of the same name), and a `let`
cannot be assigned to, as in a file. Each input is checked with everything defined before it, so a type error
shows the line and leaves the session as it was. A number written alone (`let n = 4`) is an `Int`, so that
functions that take an `Int` accept it. A closure needs the type of its parameters to be kept
(`let inc = (n: Int) => n + 1`).

Commands start with a colon: `:type <expression>`, `:vars`, `:defs`, `:load <file>`, `:reset`, `:help` and
`:quit`. Tab completes names, fields and methods, and the arrow keys go through earlier inputs (kept in
`~/.telvax_history`; `TELVAX_HISTORY` names another file). `--allow` limits what the session may do, as for
`telvax run`. Each input is run once: what it prints or writes happens once, and values are not computed again
when the next input is entered.

## Debugging

```sh
telvax dap       # a debug adapter on standard input and output
```

In VS Code, F5 on a Telvax file debugs it (see the extension's README). `telvax dap` speaks the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/), so an
editor that has a client for it can run a program in the interpreter, stop it at breakpoints and step through
it. Its launch request takes `program` (the `.tvx` file), `function` (default `main`), `args` (the words
you would give `telvax run`), `stopOnEntry`, `noDebug` and `allow` (the same list as `--allow`). It stops
before each statement, so a breakpoint goes on a line that starts a statement; on any other line it moves
to the next one that does. While stopped it lists the calls in progress and their variables, and a name or
a field of one (`p.x`, `xs.0`) can be evaluated; other expressions cannot. It debugs the interpreter, not
programs from `telvax build`, and has no conditional breakpoints.

## Profiling

```sh
telvax profile app.tvx                       # runs `main` and reports where the time and memory went
telvax profile app.tvx handler 3 "text"      # another function, with its arguments
telvax profile app.tvx --top 30 --json r.json --collapsed stacks.txt --speedscope p.json
```

The report has four parts: the wall time and the memory (the peak, the bytes allocated and how many
allocations); the functions, with calls, the time in the function itself (`self`) and with the calls it
makes (`total`), and the bytes it allocated; the statements, with how often each ran and how long it took
until the next one of the same call started; and the `std` functions (`std.tensor.matmul`,
`std.table.sql`, ...), with calls, time, the rows or elements that went in and came out, and the bytes of the
result. `--json` writes all of it to a file, `--collapsed` writes call stacks for `flamegraph.pl` or
`inferno`, and `--speedscope` writes a file for <https://www.speedscope.app>.

Times are measured by the interpreter around what the program does, so they show where the *program*
spends its time and include the time of the interpreter itself. Memory counts the whole process, so with
several threads a function also counts what the other threads allocate meanwhile. Programs built with
`telvax build` are not profiled.

## Documentation

`telvax doc` writes a Markdown reference from the code: each function with its signature, each `type` with
a table of fields (and defaults), each `enum` with its variants, each `trait`, and the methods under `extend`.
The `#` comment lines written directly above an item (no blank line between) become its description.

```sh
telvax doc file.tvx                # print the reference of one file
telvax doc src/ -o REFERENCE.md    # every `.tvx` file under the directory, written to a file
telvax doc --public src/           # leave out names that start with `_`
```

```tvx
# Sum of the first `n` squares.
fn squares(n: Int) -> Int:
    n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
```

## Formatting and linting

```sh
telvax fmt file.tvx            # rewrite in place
telvax fmt src/ tests/         # every `.tvx` file under the directories (no path: this directory)
telvax fmt --check             # list files that would change (exit 1), for CI
telvax fmt --diff src/         # show the lines that would change, write nothing (exit 1)
telvax lint file.tvx           # unused variables, unused private functions, unreachable cases
telvax lint --list-rules       # the rules and what they find
```

Each lint rule has a name (`unused-variable`, `unused-function`, `unreachable-case`) and a level:
`allow` (say nothing), `warn` (the default) or `deny` (an error, so `telvax lint` fails). Set the
levels for a package in `telvax.toml`, or for one run with `--allow rule`, `--warn rule` and
`--deny rule`; a flag wins over the file. `--deny-warnings` makes any warning fail the run.

```toml
[lint]
unused-variable = "deny"
unused-function = "allow"
```

Indentation is part of the syntax, so `telvax fmt` never moves a line between blocks: it sets four
spaces per level, spaces inside a line, continuation lines and blank lines. Directories skip hidden
folders, `target`, `node_modules` and `.tvpm`.

The language server completes names as you type: types after `:` and `->`, the fields, columns and
methods after a dot (also after calls such as `s.trim().`), the variants after `Shape.`, the parameter of
a closure you are writing (`xs.map(p => p.`) and the columns of a table inside `t.sql("..`. What fits the
type the code expects comes first.

The language server formats documents too, so VS Code can format on save. It also finds all
references to a variable, function, global, type, enum variant, field or method and renames them (a
rename is refused when the new name would collide with another one in scope, when a file has a syntax
error, or when the name belongs to a dependency). They follow imports into the other files of the project.

## Strings and lists

```telvax
fn demo(s: Text) -> u64:
    let words = s.split(" ")  # List[Text]
    words.push("extra")
    if s.contains("telvax") and not s.starts_with("#"):
        return words.len()
    0
```

`Text`: `len`, `is_empty`, `trim`, `to_lowercase`, `to_uppercase`, `contains`, `starts_with`,
`ends_with`, `replace`, `split`. `List`: `len`, `is_empty`, `push`, `contains`. `x in xs` is
`xs.contains(x)`. A method that does not exist is a compile error with a "did you mean" hint.
These methods run in the interpreter; the native backend still only has `len` and `is_empty`.

## Optional values, maps and small functions

```telvax
fn demo(text: Text) -> Int:
    let counts: Map[Text, Int] = std.map.new()
    for word in text.split(" "):
        let seen = counts.get(word).unwrap_or(0)  # Int?
        counts.insert(word, seen + 1)
    match counts.get("telvax"):
        case Some(n):
            n
        case None:
            0
```

* `T?` is `Some(value)` or `None`; `match` must cover both. Methods: `is_some`, `is_none`,
  `unwrap` (an error on `None`), `unwrap_or`, `unwrap_or_else(() => v)`, `expect("message")`,
  `map`, `and_then`, `filter` and `ok_or(error)`, which turns it into a `Result`. Several methods return one: `List.first`, `last`,
  `pop`, `get`, `Text.find`, `to_int`, `to_float`, `Map.get`, `remove`. As JSON, `None` is
  `null` and `Some(x)` is just `x`.
* `Map[K, V]` has `Text`, integer or `Bool` keys. It is created with `std.map.new()` and a
  type annotation, and has `insert`, `get`, `remove`, `contains_key`, `len`, `is_empty`, `keys` and
  `values`. Like `List`, copies share the same entries. Keys are kept in order; JSON objects use
  string keys.
* `List` also has `sort` (numbers, strings, bools) and `reverse`; `Text` has `chars` and `lines`.
* Functions are values. The type of one is written like a header without the name:
  `(Int, Int) -> Int`, `() -> Text`, `(Int) -> ()` for one that returns nothing. A name can hold a
  function (`let f = twice`), and a parameter, a field, a list element or a return value can too:
  `fn apply(f: (Int) -> Int, x: Int) -> Int: f(x)`, `fn adder(n: Int) -> (Int) -> Int: x => x + n`.
  A closure parameter can say its type: `(x: Int) => x + 1`. Calling a function with the wrong
  number or types of arguments is a compile error that shows both types.
* `x => x + 1` and `(a, b) => a + b` are one-line functions. For more, write an `fn` inside the
  function: `fn add(a: Int): a + k`. Both capture variables by value, so assigning to a variable
  from outside is a compile error; shared `List` and `Map` values can still be changed from
  inside one.
* These run in the interpreter; the native backend does not compile them yet.

## Tables and tensors, the short way

```telvax
type Sale:
    id: Int
    region: Text
    units: Int
    price: Float

fn main():
    let sales: Table[Sale] = read_csv("examples/dataframe/sales.csv")
    print(f"mean price: {sales.price.mean()}")

    let by_region: Table[{region: Text, revenue: Float}] = sales.sql("SELECT region, SUM(units * price) AS revenue FROM t GROUP BY region")
    for row in by_region:
        print(f"{row.region}: {row.revenue}")
```

* Every function and method of the standard library, with its type, is in [the reference](../reference/std.md).
* `print`, `read_csv`, `read_parquet` and `read_ipc` need no `std.` prefix. `print` ends the line;
  `std.io.print` writes without one.
* Methods on tensors are the `std.tensor` functions: `x.matmul(w).relu().softmax()`,
  `sales.price.mean()`. A table has `sql`. They are the same calls underneath, so
  `std.tensor.relu(x)` still works.
* Operators on tensors: `a + b`, `a - b`, `a * b`, `a / b` (same shape) and `a * k`, `k * a` to
  scale by a number.
* `Table[{region: Text, revenue: Float}]` writes the row type in place; no throwaway type for
  the result of a query. The same columns mean the same type everywhere.
* `fn main():` may return nothing.

See `examples/dataframe/`. The pandas version of the same program is about as long, but the
Telvax one checks the column names and types before it runs.

## Errors, tuples and iterators

```telvax
fn split_pair(line: Text) -> Result[(Text, Text), Text]:
    let parts = line.split("=")
    if parts.len() != 2:
        return Err(f"bad line: {line}")
    Ok((parts[0].trim(), parts[1].trim()))

fn port_of(line: Text) -> Result[Int, Text]:
    let key, value = split_pair(line)?  # `?` returns the Err early
    match value.to_int():
        case Some(n):
            Ok(n)
        case None:
            Err(f"not a number: {value}")

fn main():
    let xs = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
    let big = xs.filter(x => x > 2).map(x => x * 10)  # [30, 40, 50]
    for i, x in xs.enumerate():
        print(f"{i}: {x}")
    let stack = [1, 2, 3]
    while stack.pop() is Some(top):
        print(f"{top}")
    if xs.first() is Some(first):
        print(f"first = {first}")
```

* `Result[T, E]` has `is_ok`, `is_err`, `unwrap` and `expect("message")` (both stop the program
  with the error), `unwrap_or(v)`, `unwrap_or_else(e => v)`, `map`, `map_err`, `and_then`, and `ok()` /
  `err()`, which give an `Option`. `and_then` must return a `Result` with the same error type; use
  `map_err` to change it first. A method that does not exist is a compile error.
* `expr?` on a `Result` or `Option` returns the error (or `None`) from the current function; the
  function's return type must be a `Result` or `T?` too, and the error types must match.
* `if x is Pattern:` and `while x is Pattern:` match one pattern and bind its names; they work
  with `break` and `continue`, and `else:` runs when the pattern does not match.
* Tuples: the type `(A, B)`, values `(1, "a")`, fields `.0` and `.1`, and destructuring in
  `let a, b = pair`, `for` loops and `((a, b)) => ...` (one tuple argument taken apart).
* `List` methods `map`, `filter`, `any`, `all`, `find`, `enumerate`, `zip`, `sum`, `min`, `max`,
  `fold`, `for_each`, `skip` and `join`, and `Map.entries`. `min`, `max` and `find` return an
  `Option`. These run in the interpreter; the native backend does not compile them yet.

## Types, methods, traits and generics

```telvax
trait Shape:
    fn area(self) -> Float: ...

    fn describe(self) -> Text:
        f"area {self.area()}"

type Circle(Shape):
    r: Float

    fn area(self) -> Float:
        self.r * self.r * 3.14159

type Stack[T]:
    items: List[T]

    fn push(self, x: T):
        self.items.push(x)
```

A `type` lists its fields, then its methods. `type Circle(Shape)` says the type implements the
trait; a method without a body (`: ...`) is required, one with a body is a default. `extend Circle:`
adds methods to a type declared elsewhere. Call a function that has no `self` as `Circle.new(1.0)`.
`[T]` after a name declares a type parameter; `T: Shape` limits it to types that implement `Shape`.
A method can have type parameters of its own, besides those of its type:
`fn map[U](self, f: (T) -> U) -> Stack[U]`. They are inferred from the call (`s.map(x => x * 2)`), and
each different choice makes its own instance. A method of a trait cannot have them.
A generic function is called with its types inferred from the arguments. When they cannot be (a
function that takes nothing), or to be explicit, write them before the parentheses:
`empty[Text]()`, `pair[Int, Text](1, "a")`. The types are names such as `Int` or `List[Text]`.
Three limits need no trait of your own: `T: Num` (`Int`, `Float` and the sized numbers), `T: Ord`
(numbers and `Text`, the values `<` and `>` compare) and `T: Eq` (everything but functions). More than
one: `T: (Num, Ord)`. A type that does not meet a limit is an error at the call that uses it, and a
trait of yours named `Num`, `Ord` or `Eq` takes precedence.
