# Command line

`telvax` is one program with several commands: `telvax <command> [options]`. `telvax --version` prints the
version and `telvax --help` prints the list below. `telvax doctor` says what the build you have can do.

## Synopsis

```text
usage:
  telvax check [--json] [file.tvx...]                       no file: the package in this directory
  telvax lint <file.tvx> [--allow|--warn|--deny rule]... [--deny-warnings] [--list-rules]
                                                            unused variables and functions, unreachable cases

                                                            time per function, line and std operation, and memory
  telvax doctor                                             what this build can do and how it is set up
  telvax repl [file.tvx...] [--allow list]                  type definitions, variables and expressions and see the result

                                                    (all but stablehlo need --features llvm)

--allow takes a list of fs.read, fs.write, fs, env, net, all, none. Without it everything is allowed.
```

This block is the output of `telvax --help`, and a test checks that it still is.

## Exit status

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The command did what it was asked. |
| 1 | It failed: a program with errors, a failing test, a file that needs formatting, a missing file. The reason is printed after `error:`. |
| 2 | It was called wrongly: an unknown command (with a suggestion when one is close) or options that do not fit. |

## Options several commands share

`--allow list`
: The permissions the program has: `fs.read`, `fs.write`, `fs` (both), `env`, `net`, `all` or `none`, separated by commas
  (`--allow fs.read,net`). A function that needs one that was not given stops with an error. Without `--allow`
  everything is allowed. Taken by `run`, `test`, `profile`, `repl` and `serve`. (`lint` has its own
  `--allow rule`, see below.)

`--quantize int8 | int8-channel | int4-channel | none`
: Runs `f32` matrix products with integer arithmetic. See the section Quantization of the [tour](../guide/tour.md). Taken by `run`, `serve` and `build`.

`--device cpu | gpu`
: Where tensor operations run; `gpu` needs a build with the `gpu` feature and a GPU (`telvax doctor` says if the build has it). Taken by `run` and `serve`.

`--workers host:port,host:port`
: Sends the calls of `std.dist.map` to machines that run `telvax worker`. The environment variable `TELVAX_WORKERS` is the
  default. Taken by `run` and `serve`.

## Commands

### `telvax check`

Parses and type-checks the files named, or, with none, the package in the current directory (the one with a
`telvax.toml`). Prints each error with its place, and fails if there is any.
`--json` prints the diagnostics as JSON, one object each with `file`, `line`, `column`, `end_line`, `end_column`,
`severity`, `message` and `notes`, for editors and scripts.

### `telvax lint`

Checks a file, then reports code that is not used: variables, functions, cases that can never be reached.
`--list-rules` prints every rule with what it finds. The level of a rule (`allow`, `warn`, `deny`) comes from the
`[lint]` table of `telvax.toml` and then from the flags `--allow rule`, `--warn rule` and `--deny rule`.
`--deny-warnings` makes a warning fail the command.

### `telvax fmt`

Rewrites files in the one format Telvax has, and prints `formatted <file>` for each one it changed. A folder means
every `.tvx` file under it; no path means the current directory; `-` reads the source from the standard input and
writes the result to the standard output. `--check` changes nothing and fails if a file would change, which is what a
CI job wants. `--diff` shows what would change.

### `telvax doc`

Writes a Markdown reference of the functions, types, enums and traits in the files named (a folder means every `.tvx`
file under it), with the `#` comment lines written directly above each one. `--public` leaves out the names that
start with `_`. `-o out.md` writes a file instead of the standard output.

### `telvax test`

Runs the functions named `test_...` in a file; a test passes when it returns and fails when it stops with an error
(`assert`, `assert_eq`, `fail`, any runtime error). A folder runs every `test_*.tvx` and `*_test.tvx` file under it. A
second word, `name`, runs only the tests whose name contains it. It prints `N passed, M failed` and fails if any test
did. `--coverage` also reports which lines of the program the tests ran; `--fail-under N` (0 to 100) turns that into a
gate: the command fails if fewer than `N` percent of the lines ran. The functions of `std.test`, such as
`mock`, are in the [library reference](std.md).

### `telvax run`

Calls a function of a program: `telvax run app.tvx main`, or just `telvax run app.tvx` to call `main`. The words after the
function name are its arguments, in order. A `Text` parameter takes the word as it is; any other type takes JSON (`3`,
`true`, `[1, 2]`, `{"a": 1}`). The value the function returns is printed, unless it returns nothing.

### `telvax profile`

Runs a function like `run` and reports where the time and the memory went: per function, per line and per `std`
operation. `--top N` limits the report to the `N` statements that took the longest. `--json file`, `--collapsed file` (for flame graph tools) and
`--speedscope file` also write the report in those formats.

### `telvax doctor`

Prints the version, the syntax editions it reads, what this build can do (`tables`, live services, GPU, native
backend) and the environment variables that matter (`TELVAX_LIVE`, `OLLAMA_HOST`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`TELVAX_WORKERS`, `TELVAX_CLUSTER_TOKEN`). A key or a token is shown as `set` or `not set`, never its value. Put the
output in a bug report.

### `telvax repl`

Starts an interactive session: type definitions, variables and expressions, and see the result. Files named on the
command line are loaded first. The same session is in the playground. In the session, `:help` lists its commands.

### `telvax dap`

The debug adapter (breakpoints, stepping, variables), speaking the Debug Adapter Protocol over the standard input and
output. Editors start it; the VS Code extension does. You do not run it by hand.

### `telvax lsp`

The language server, speaking the Language Server Protocol over the standard input and output. Editors start it; the
VS Code extension does. You do not run it by hand.

### `telvax worker`

Runs calls for a coordinator, so that `--workers` can spread `std.dist.map` over machines. It listens on
`--listen host:port` (default `127.0.0.1:7077`) and, when `--token T` or the environment variable
`TELVAX_CLUSTER_TOKEN` is set, answers only to a coordinator that has the same token.

### `telvax serve`

Serves the `@endpoint` functions of a program over HTTP, with the request validated and the answer written as JSON,
until it is stopped (Ctrl-C or SIGTERM). It listens on `--host` (default `127.0.0.1`) and `--port` (default `8080`). A program
without `@endpoint` functions is an error. `--live` uses the real Ollama, OpenAI and PostgreSQL services instead of the
offline stand-ins (and needs `net`). `--seed docs.jsonl` fills the vector store before the first request: one JSON
object per line with the text fields `collection`, `id` and `text`; each text is embedded and stored.

### `telvax build --serve`

Makes one executable that contains the program and the server: `telvax build --serve app.tvx -o app`. It copies the
`telvax` that runs the command and appends the program, so it is as large as `telvax`. When started it
serves the program: it listens on `0.0.0.0`, on `PORT` if that is set, and `--port` and `--host` still win. `HOST` sets
the address, and `TELVAX_LIVE=1` turns on `--live`. `--dockerfile` also writes a `Dockerfile` for it.

### `telvax build`

Compiles a program with the native backend (LLVM and MLIR), so it needs a `telvax` built with `--features llvm`; the
published binaries are not, and `telvax doctor` says. `--emit` picks the output: `exe` (default, a program named after
the file), `obj` (an object file), `llvm-ir` and `mlir` (printed), `ptx` (printed; `--sm sm_80` picks the GPU
generation) and `stablehlo` (printed). `-o` names the output file. `-O 0` to `-O 3` is the optimisation level
(default 2). `--emit ptx` and `--emit stablehlo` do not need the native backend.

### `telvax jit`

Compiles a function with the native backend and calls it at once: `telvax jit app.tvx norm 3.0 4.0`. Needs `--features llvm`.
